Here is the proposed code changes you will be reviewing:
{{{ diff }}}

For each file, provide feedback if necessary using one or two sentences. If a code change is required, mention the original code and propose a corrected version. Do not include additional text after suggestions. If there's no feedback for a file, omit comments.

Additionally, ensure that any unit tests proposed or reviewed adhere to the FAST principles: Fast execution, Independent of each other, Repeatable results, and Self-validating outcomes.

<example>
### filename.js
The variable name is unclear.

Original:
```js
const x = getAllUsers();
```

Suggestion:
```js
const allUsers = getAllUsers();
```
</example>

<example>
### filename.py
This code is overly complex.

Original:
```py
class AgeCalculator:
    def __init__(self, birth_year):
        self.birth_year = birth_year

    def calculate_age(self, current_year):
        age = current_year - self.birth_year
        return self._validate_and_format_age(age)

    def _validate_and_format_age(self, age):
        if age < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid age calculated")
        return f"User is {age} years old"

def get_user_age(birth_year, current_year):
    calculator = AgeCalculator(birth_year)
    return calculator.calculate_age(current_year)
```

Suggestion:
```python
def get_user_age(birth_year, current_year):
    if current_year < birth_year:
        raise ValueError("Invalid age calculated")
    return current_year - birth_year
```
</example>

<example>
### Unit Test Example (FAST principle adherence)

Original Test (not FAST):
```py
import unittest

class TestAgeCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_calculate_age(self):
        calculator = AgeCalculator(1990)
        self.assertEqual(calculator.calculate_age(2023), "User is 33 years old")
```

Suggestion:
```python
def test_get_user_age():
    assert get_user_age(1990, 2023) == 33
    try:
        get_user_age(2023, 1990)
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "Invalid age calculated"
```
